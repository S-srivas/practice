Hey, hey
Everybody
We've got something to say
We may seem as different
As the night is from day
But you look a little deeper
And you will see
That I'm just like you
And you're just like me
Yeah

Hey, hey
Everybody
We're here to shout
That the magic of friendship is what it's all about
Yeah, we thought we were different
As the night is from the day
Until Twilight Sparkle helped us see another way

So get up,
Get down
If you're gonna come around
We can work together
Helping Twilight win the crown
So get up,
Get down
'Cause it's gonna make a sound
If we work together
Helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown

Hey, hey
Hands up now
We're sending a message to the crowd
Hands wave up,
Then comes down
We party together all around
Generous, honesty
Laughter, kindness, loyalty
Twilight helped us each to see
All that we can be

So get up,
Get down
If you're gonna come around
We can work together
Helping Twilight win the crown
So get up,
Get down
'Cause it's gonna make a sound
If we work together
Helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown

I'm gonna be myself
No matter what I do
And if we're different
Yeah
I want you to be true to you
If you follow me
We'll put our differences aside
We'll stick together
And start working on that school pride!
